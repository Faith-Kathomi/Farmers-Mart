  - **Middleware**: Implements HTTP middleware for request processing.

- `database/`:
  - Contains migrations, seeders, and database factories.
  - **Migrations**: Define database schema changes using PHP.
  - **Seeders**: Populate the database with initial data for testing and development.
  - **Factories**: Define blueprints for generating fake data during testing.

## Key Files
